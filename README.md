# Network Performance Testing Using Cisco Packet Tracer

## Overview
This focuses on measuring and analyzing **network performance metrics** such as **latency, bandwidth, jitter, and packet loss** using Cisco Packet Tracer. Students will gain hands-on experience with testing, diagnosing network issues, and optimizing performance.

## Objectives
- Measure **latency** and **packet loss** using **ping** and **traceroute**.
- Analyze **bandwidth usage** using Packet Tracerâ€™s built-in **traffic generator**.
- Measure **jitter** by simulating and monitoring different types of traffic.
- Document results and propose **network optimizations**.

## Lab Requirements
- **Software**: Cisco Packet Tracer
- **Devices**: At least **two routers** and **two PCs** (one as a client, one as a server)
- **Tools**:
  - **Ping & Traceroute** for latency and packet loss
  - **Traffic Generator** for bandwidth and jitter analysis
  - **Packet Sniffer** for detailed network traffic analysis

## Lab Setup
1. **Create a simple network topology** with two routers and two PCs.
2. **Set up a LAN or WAN** between routers and assign IP addresses.
3. **Ensure basic connectivity** using ping tests.

## Lab Tasks
### Task 1: Latency & Packet Loss Testing
- Use **ping** to measure **round-trip time (RTT)**.
- Use **traceroute** to identify network path and latency at each hop.

### Task 2: Bandwidth Analysis
- Use **Traffic Generator** to simulate different data sizes (e.g., 1MB, 10MB).
- Observe bandwidth usage in **Simulation Mode**.

### Task 3: Jitter Testing
- Simulate **VoIP/video traffic** to measure **delay variations**.
- Compare jitter values to performance thresholds.

### Task 4: Packet Analysis
- Capture network traffic using **Packet Sniffer**.
- Analyze **RTT, jitter, and packet retransmissions**.
